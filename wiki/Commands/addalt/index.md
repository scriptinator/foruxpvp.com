Adds a specific player or all players on a server to your alt list. Meant to be used together with [Force OP (AuthMeCracker)](/wiki/Force_OP_(AuthMeCracker)).

Alts are "alternative" player names that you can use on servers. There is a difference between cracked Alts, which you can only use on cracked servers and premium Alts, which you can use everywhere. The `.addalt` command can only be used to add cracked Alts.

To manage your Alts, use the AltManager.

## Syntax
- `.addalt <player>` adds the entered player to your alt list.

- `.addalt all` adds all players on the server you are playing on to your alt list.
